# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Fresco's Storybook

Fresco is a component library and thriving Design System for Web3. Fresco is not ready for production and it's still a work in progress.
Yet, you can see our development storybook to playground what we are building ðŸ¤—.

Below you can apreciate the example of our so-called `"atoms"`. Think of this as React wrappers for commonly adopted [**Ethereum ERCs**](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc) (`primarily ERC20, ERC721, ERC4626`).

# ðŸ‘‰ BalanceOf(`vitalik.eth`)

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example">
    <BalanceOf.render
      chainId={mainnet.id}
      account="0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

# Props

Just as the wagmi team. We plan to keep a consistent naming for props across the atoms and each component's API.
The following is a draft reference:

```ts
export type Props = {
  account?: `0x${string}`
  token?: `0x${string}`
  chainId?: number
  decimals?: number
  enabled?: boolean
  refetchInterval?: "block" | number
  onChangeStatus?: (data: any) => void
  onDataFetched?: (data: any) => void
  onError?: (error: Error) => void
  children: (prop: {
    data: DataType
    isSuccess: boolean
    isLoading: boolean
    isError: boolean
    error: Error | null
  }) => JSX.Element
}
```

# Try it out

Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation.
And you can manipulate component properties for this example as you wish [**in this section**](/story/atoms-erc20--balance-of).
